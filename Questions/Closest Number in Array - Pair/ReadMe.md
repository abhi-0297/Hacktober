# Closest Number in Array - Pair

Given a list of distinct unsorted integers, find the pair of elements that have the smallest absolute difference between them? If there are multiple pairs, find them all.

## Examples:
- Input : arr[] = {10, 50, 12, 100}
- Output : (10, 12)
## 
- Input : arr[] = {5, 4, 3, 2}
- Output : (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)
